# Machine Learning
The repository contains code for different types of Machine Learning Models. For each type of Model, I have performed 
following steps:
1. Preprocess the data
2. Training model
3. Making Predictions
4. Visualizing the predictions on training and test data

Along with this I have added a data prepossessing script that can be used in most of the cases.
# Tools and Technologies:

Following are the tools and technologies used in the project:
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Python
